# Instructions on how to use the KeychainCam:

1. Connect a LiPo battery to the device (with the SD card already in place) via the re-connectorized thin leads. Once this is done, a blue LED should light up showing that the device is powered
2. Test the operation of the device. Touching the trigger wire to the metal shielding on the SD card slot (which is already connected to Ground) for half a second will take a photo (indicated by one red LED blink). Holding the trigger to ground for a bit longer will start a video recording (indicated by an indefinite blinking red LED), and holding it to ground again will end the recording (signalled by the end of the blinking).
3. If successfull, the SD card will show two folders when ejected and viewed on a computer. One folder will contain photos and the other will contain videos.

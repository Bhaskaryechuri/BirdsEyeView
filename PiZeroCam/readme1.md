# Instructions on how to use this device:
1. Connect a LiPo battery to the smaller blue power regulator board mounted onto the Pi Zero. 
   1. Once this is done, an LED should light up on the Pi Zero and on the power regulator board showing that the device is powered 
   2. (_NOTE: ensure that the battery is adequately charged before connecting it to the device. A over-depleted LiPo battery can overheat and be dangerous to use_)
3. Once powered, the device will turn on automatically (indicated by an LED on the Pi Zero), and a few seconds later, the recording will automatically start (indicated by a red LED next to the camera). The recording ends automatically when disconnected from a power source.
4. To view the recordings, connect the Pi Zero to 
   1. a monitor via HDMI, 
   2. to a mouse/keyboard via USB, 
   3. and to the Raspberry Pi wall power supply
5. Once the Pi boots up, the videos will be located on the desktop, from which the files can be transferred via the internet or an external hard drive.
